This repo provides pure Python 3 implementations of various cryptosystems and protocols, authored by me without external dependencies. Provided implementations are for educational purposes only, these implementations are not cryptographically secure (e.g. Python's <i>random</i> library was used for PRNG, it uses linear congruential generators which are cryptographically insecure).
